## Legal Stuff

_repeated just incase anyone gets clever_

I've looked at the various licenses on github but I don't read lawyer well. My code is open, do with it as you please. Giving credit would be appreciated but I won't go to war over it.

That said, as outlined in the [credits](https://grousewood-games.github.io/solforge/docs/faq#credits), a good portion of this is the intellectual property of others. Trying to take anything from this repo and monetize it in any form is highly inadvisable. You might get a lunch date with a cease & desist.

Use your noggin :brain:. Show respect :trophy:.
